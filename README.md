# Text-Based-Ticket-Booking
I developed a text-based ticket booking system using Core Java that allows users to check seat availability and book multiple seats in a simple console interface. The app displays seats using intuitive symbols (□ for available, ■ for booked), collects passenger details like name, age, contact, pickup point, and drop point, and generates ticket.
